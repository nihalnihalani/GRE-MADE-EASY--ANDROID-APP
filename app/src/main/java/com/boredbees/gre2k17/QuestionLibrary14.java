            "reconstructing the visual experience of the monument before they can even begin interpreting it. To do so, an\n" +

            "meaning. Considering the various fragments of the Parthenon frieze as a whole and comparing it to other\n" +
            "Greek artworks, two aspects of the arrangement immediately strike the informed viewer.\n" +
            "First, it is clear that the frieze is meant to be thought of as a continuous whole. This isparticularly interesting because it is completely unprecedented in Greek art. Continuous friezes on the faces\n" +
            "of Greek temples generally depicted single subjects, but if continued over all four sides of a building, the four\n" +
            "stretches of the frieze would generally be thematically separate.\n" +
            "The second unique aspect of the Parthenon frieze has to do with the fundamental nature of Greek art;\n" +
            "namely that all works of art prior to the Parthenon frieze depicted only scenes from myth and legend. Yet, in this relief, for the first time in the history of Greek art, we find mortals, leading\n" +
            "some scholars to the conclusion that what is depicted is a specific event that actually took place at a specific\n" +
            "time and place.","A single short story can suggest a desired response from the reader. It is a difficult task, though, to create\n" +
            "a world within a single short story and then repeat this world again in other stories while maintaining a\n" +
            "consistent flow of ideas. Many authors prefer to use the same setting, indeed, often the same characters in\n" +
            "each story. Isabel Allende’s Diez Cuentos’ de Eva Luna comes to mind. In these stories, Allende uses the small town of Agua Santa as the setting for the entire\n" +

            "Woman Hollering Creek is a collection of short stories by Sandra Cisneros. Rather than using the same\n" +
            "characters or setting throughout the collection, Cisneros takes a different approach to relating her stories to\n" +
            "one another. Much of the burden, in fact, is placed on the reader, for the characters change each time, as does the setting. Furthermore, while the characters are\n" +
            "largely Mexican American immigrant women, each character presents a distinct style and literary voice. What\n" +
            "these works have in common is more intuitive; mood, circumstance, time, tone, and imagery all play a role in\n" +
            "creating the world in which the stories take place.","Scottish economist Adam Smith’s The Wealth of Nations heralded—or caused—the market-based\n" +
            "economic system that has increasingly become the norm since the book’s publication in 1776. Some say that\n" +
            "Smith’s magnum opus was to economics as Newton’s Principia Mathematica was to physics or as Darwin’s\n" +
            "On the Origin of Species was for biology. Certainly the book made its impact in the early United States.\n" +
            "1776 predates wide usage of the term capitalism, now commonly associated with Smith, and which\n" +
            "Smith refers to as a “system of natural liberty.” Smith presented what we today consider Economics 101:\n" +
            "supply and demand, and the importance of specialization and the division of labor. He also posited that\n" +
            "individuals pursuing their own self-interest could unintentionally create a more just society by so doing—an idea sometimes referred to as the “Invisible Hand.”\n" +
            "Even Smith’s critics do not deny the book’s immense influence. Murray Rothbard levels the criticism\n" +
            "that The Wealth of Nations, in fact, eclipsed public knowledge of all economists—better ones, he says—\n" +
            "before Smith.","Fame and fortune are often associated with virtue, industry, and a host of other attributes. However,\n" +
            "random strokes of fate often determine such success and said commonly perceived virtues prove irrelevant.\n" +
            "For instance, decades after her death, Coco Chanel remains the epitome of French fashion and her name, as\n" +
            "well as the company she founded, is known throughout the world. Yet, few realize that she, while undeniably talented, initially succeeded by leveraging her\n" +
            "status as a courtesan. As a company owner, it would be an understatement to say that she was not known for her\n" +
            "generous treatment of her employees. During the Nazi occupation, she lived a privileged life at the Hotel Ritz\n" +
            "and her lover at the time was a German intelligence operative.Conversely, there is the example of Madeleine Vionnet, a professional contemporary of Chanel. She is\n" +
            "often credited with permanently transforming fashion through her use of the bias cut—cutting material against\n" +
            "the grain of the fabric. In the 1930’s, her gowns were worn by Hollywood stars, and her standing was second to\n" +
            "none. She was also, in many ways, an early feminist, establishing largely unheard of employee benefits—such\n" +
            "as day care and medical care—for her largely female staff. In addition, she lobbied for fashion copyright protections. When the\n" +
            "Second World War broke out, she closed her business and simply retired. Today, she is largely unknown\n" +

            "record. The “aquatic ape theory” gained prominence as an explanation for this gap. This theory posited that\n" +
            "primitive humans were forced toward a littoral lifestyle by competition for arboreal resources. Analogies\n" +
            "were made to seal populations, who sleep on land at night but spend most of their days in coastal waters. Proponents pointed to various physiological human\n" +
            "attributes, such as bipedalism and the webbing between human toes, as extant adaptations.\n" +
            "However, the aspect of the theory that captured the public imagination and undoubtedly boosted its\n" +
            "standing was the point that this hypothesis explained human hairlessness; as with dolphins, this streamlining would facilitate swimming and diving. Proponents noted that the remaining body\n" +
            "hair would match the flow of water, and extreme advocates explained the gender difference in hair by\n" +
