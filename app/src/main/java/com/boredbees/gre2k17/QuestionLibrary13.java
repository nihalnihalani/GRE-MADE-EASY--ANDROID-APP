            "much of contemporary art has been criticized as cold, unapproachable, impersonal, and emotionless. One link\n" +
            "between the immediately appealing, expressive paintings that are often the most popular museum attractions\n" +
            "and the “brainy” constructivist school of art pioneered in the early twentieth century is the notion of gesture as an expressive tool.\n" +
            "Mark di Suvero’s Iroquois (1983–1999) is composed of several industrial-sized I-beams. The materials\n" +
            "are so heavy and large the artist used cranes and other construction tools to manipulate and connect the beams,\n" +
            "all of which have been painted a bright red-orange. The result is an intruding work of almost architectural dimensions that one can immediately sense is terribly heavy\n" +

            "structure, backing away to see it from a distance, the linear forms became considerably more complex than\n" +
            "one might presume. The tangled steel was obviously constructed with great care, yet each piece seems to\n" +
            "threaten the viewer with its weight and size, jutting out away from the central nexus, daring the entire form to topple over. At the same\n" +
            "time, the piece seems to exude stability, balance, even serenity. Iroquois resonates with an energy born not of\n" +
            "the physical quality of the sculpture, which is quite passive and stable, but rather of the gestural quality of the\n" +
            "forms.","In his Discourse on Inequality, Rousseau posits that early social contract theories establish unjust social\n" +
            "and politics arrangements that provide only the appearance of legitimacy and equality.\n" +
            "In Rousseau’s accounting, the beginnings of the social contract lie in the fears of the rich.In a state of nature, one in which there is no government or law to control the interactions of people, the rich\n" +
            "would have great difficulty protecting the property that they possess. Thus, the rich turn to the mechanism of\n" +
            "the social contact to shore up the holdings Rousseau views as “hoarded.” The concept of a social contract is\n" +
            "appealing to the poor, because the poor fear death in a state of lawlessness and thus seek protection. To obtain\n" +
            "assent to the contract, the rich focus their rhetoric on a seeming equality of obligation by creating rules that apply equally to all\n" +
            "members of society. This system, however, simply systematizes the “theft” the rich had perpetrated on the\n" +
            "poor in the pre-law state of nature.\n" +
            "Rousseau then begins to develop his own vision of a social contract, through which he attempts to right\n" +
            "these injustices. His first departure from earlier theorists is in the formation ofthe sovereign. Rather than members of the state surrendering their rights to another person—an irrational\n" +
            "course of action tantamount to surrendering oneself into slavery—they surrender their right to all members of\n" +
            "the society and thus to no one. Rousseau refers to this sovereign as the “general will” and it has the task of\n" +
            "legislating for the new civil society that is created in the contract.Unlike early social contract theories, Rousseau’s version conceives of property rights that allow for\n" +
            "rights of first occupancy to justify claims, rather than rights of the strongest. In this system, property can be\n" +
            "taken only if it has not been previously occupied and only to the degree necessary for the subsistence of those\n" +
            "taking it, measures intended as a check to the hoarding of property by force enshrined in earlier contract\n" +
            "theory.","In the twenty-first century, terrorism has become a common term in the day-to-day political vernacular.\n" +
            "However, despite its prevalence in everyday conversation, the term terrorism is not easily defined.\n" +
            "First, there is the question of target. There is a large debate over what the target ofterror must be. Many writers believe that the targeting of “innocents” is a key component of terrorism.\n" +
            "Douglas Lackey writes, “…the common soldier is not a terrorist, because the majority of his victims are\n" +
            "soldiers, and a minority of his victims are civilians.” All bombs kill things in their target radius regardless of\n" +
            "military status; they are indiscriminate by nature. Lackey goes on to argue that what makes a bombing\n" +
            "campaign constitute indiscriminate killing is the targeting of an area with a high ratio of non-military units to military units. Thus, discrimination is not in the\n" +
            "weapons used, but in the targets decided upon.\n" +
            "A second controversy is that of circumstance; that is, whether or not terrorist acts must be performed in\n" +
            "times of peace, or if they can include acts perpetrated during war. Some believe that even in a war, such as\n" +
            "World War II, terrorist actions can be undertaken. However, there is a viewpoint that in war the right to certain types of attack expands, making actions that might be considered\n" +
            "terrorist in other contexts (such as surprise attacks or raids) justified.\n" +
            "The final controversy is that of perpetrator size. This debate largely manifests itself in the question of\n" +
            "whether or not state actors can be accused of terrorist action. While Ariel Merari acknowledges the\n" +
            "possibility of state sponsored terrorism, he decides to narrowly define terrorism as a body of violence perpetrated by sub-state insurgent groups. He does so because, “if the\n" +
            "definition of terrorism is equally applicable to nuclear war, conventional war, and guerrilla warfare, the term\n" +
            "loses any useful meaning.” Unlike some theorists, Merari does not reject state actors because of a pro-state\n" +
            "bias, but rather concludes that the broader the term becomes, the less useful it becomes in a dialogue","The African American writer and social critic James Baldwin grew up as an outsider both to the language\n" +
            "and culture of power, and yet achieved a balance between self-expression and the language of power. In the\n" +
            "1930’s, Hollywood movies portrayed an optimistic, capitalist, white America that dealt with white issues and\n" +
            "employed white actors. As a child, Baldwin felt acutely separated from the culture of power. In “Congo Square,” Baldwin opens his essay with an important\n" +

            "saw a staircase in A Tale of Two Cities, he thought, “I knew about staircases.”\n" +
            "At the same time, Baldwin distrusted the culture of power: “The civilized … do not intend to change the\n" +
            "status quo … these people are not to be taken seriously when they speak of the ‘sanctity’ of human life, or the\n" +
